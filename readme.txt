pyrogue

rogue-like dungeon crawler game made with python, because i love
the free/libre game Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup so much (https://crawl.develz.org/).
This project was originally made during programming courses for my students at
http://spielend-programmieren.at. Versions in German language can be found 
at https://github.com/horstjens/spielend-programmieren/tree/master/pyrogue

This project is the international version in English language.
Official repository url is: https://github.com/horstjens/pyrogue

The idea is to make variants with different game engines.
Currently those versions exist, each version has it's own folder:

text .... using python3 (also works with python2.7)
pygame .. using pygame and python3 (also works with python2.7)
